# Research
**What is research in psychology?**

The goal of psychological research is to gather empirical evidence that can help explain and predict various aspects of human behavior, cognition, and emotion. Research is vital to psychology as it helps the field progress, refine theories, and apply findings to real world situations. 

Psychological research guides clinical practice in mental healthcare, contributes to creating social change, is an important component in the courtroom, can help to improve public policy, and SO much more.

Introduction to Research Methods is a required course at Smith College because of the important role research plays in psychology. Research is relevant in any field: having the skills to consume, critique, and share psychological research prepares students for various career paths.

**Why pursue research opportunities as an undergraduate?**

Volunteering in a research lab as an undergraduate is a fantastic work experience, even for those who do not intend to pursue a career in academia. As a research assistant, you'll learn to work with real datasets using analysis software, developing hard skills that will set you apart for future jobs. You'll also learn how to read, gather, and present on preexisting literature–– a skill that will prepare you to suceed in upper level coursework. Working in research also allows you to develop a strong professional network with your professors.

## How to get involved in research

## How to find jobs or internships in research
1. **Talk to your professors.** Prepare an agenda for your meeting beforehand. Consider what type of a research internship or job you're looking for (i.e. clinical, social psych, etc.), where you'd like to be geographically (do you need to be at home? on campus?), what type of funding situation you'll be in (can you work an unpaid volunteer position, apply for funding support), and what kinds of projects you'd want to work on. Your professors cannot *get* you jobs or internships, but if you provide enough information about your expectations for the position, they could help you locate several opportunities to apply for.
2. **Networking online.** Websites like LinkedIn, Handshake and the Smith Alumni Network (both for Smith students) can connect you with possible internship opportunities. In academia, LinkedIn is not as commonly used as other fields. Most researchers who network online and post internship or job opportunities are on **X/Twitter** or **BlueSky** (an alternative to X). Many research labs have accounts on these sites and will post or repost research opportunities.
3. **Peer networking.** Find out what your classmates or recent alums have done with their psychology majors! Chances are, if an internhip or job site has recently had someone from your college work for them, they may be open accepting another student. Sometimes a little bit of internet sleuthing can go a long way: look into some recent alums on various professional networking sites and figure out what they do!
